She was ... a girl like you. She died of consumption."</p><p>"A wench would have died in hospital ..." (She knows all about it already: she said "wench," not "girl.")</p><p>"She was in debt to her madam," I retorted, more and more provoked by the discussion; "and went on earning money for her up to the end, though she was in consumption. Some sledge-drivers standing by were talking about her to some soldiers and telling them so. No doubt they knew her. They were laughing. They were going to meet in a pot-house to drink to her memory."</p></div> </div>
