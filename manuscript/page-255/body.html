But I understood: there was a quiver of something different in her voice, not abrupt, harsh and unyielding as before, but something soft and shamefaced, so shamefaced that I suddenly felt ashamed and guilty.</p><p>"What?" I asked, with tender curiosity.</p><p>"Why, you..."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Why, you ... speak somehow like a book," she said, and again there was a note of irony in her voice.</p><p>That remark sent a pang to my heart. It was not what I was expecting.</p><p>I did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony, that this is usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded, and that their pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment and shrink from giving expression to their feelings before you.</p></div> </div>
