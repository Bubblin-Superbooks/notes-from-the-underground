<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The street lamps gave a disconsolate and useless glimmer. I ran two hundred paces to the cross-roads and stopped short.</p><p>Where had she gone? And why was I running after her?</p><p>Why? To fall down before her, to sob with remorse, to kiss her feet, to entreat her forgiveness! I longed for that, my whole breast was being rent to pieces, and never, never shall I recall that minute with indifference. But--what for? I thought. Should I not begin to hate her, perhaps, even tomorrow, just because I had kissed her feet today? Should I give her happiness? Had I not recognised that day, for the hundredth time, what I was worth? Should I not torture her?</p></div> </div>
