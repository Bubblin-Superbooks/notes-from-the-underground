Why don't you go?"</p><p>But at this point a strange thing happened. I was so accustomed to think and imagine everything from books, and to picture everything in the world to myself just as I had made it up in my dreams beforehand, that I could not all at once take in this strange circumstance.

She understood from all this what a woman understands first of all, if she feels genuine love, that is, that I was myself unhappy.</p></div> </div>
