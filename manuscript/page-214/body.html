<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I made a rush for the roughly made sledge; but as soon as I raised my foot to get into it, the recollection of how Simonov had just given me six roubles seemed to double me up and I tumbled into the sledge like a sack.</p><p>"No, I must do a great deal to make up for all that," I cried. "But I will make up for it or perish on the spot this very night. Start!"</p><p>We set off. There was a perfect whirl in my head.</p><p>"They won't go down on their knees to beg for my friendship. That is a mirage, cheap mirage, revolting, romantic and fantastical--that's another ball on Lake Como. And so I am bound to slap Zverkov's face! It is my duty to. And so it is settled; I am flying to give him a slap in the face. Hurry up!"</p></div> </div>
